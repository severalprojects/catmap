_Note: this code is robust enough to work on images of doggos as well as cats._

# To Run: #

Download [Processing](https://processing.org/)and open the .pde file with it. You can use your own image, currently hardcoded to be 600 x 600 pixels and called "RS2.jpg"; The image file should be in a folder called "data" in the same directory as catmap.pde
